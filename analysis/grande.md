# Introduction


- First of all what are grand tours?
  - There are 3 of them. Tour de France, Giro dItalia and Tour of Spain.
  - They are several stage (usually 21 day) pro-cycling events.

  - Riders compete with the help of their teams, in total 180 riders start.

# System and Environment
In a system model, we focus our attention to a **small portion of the
universe**, and ignore the details of the rest of the universe.
<!-- pause -->
 A valid system
> - may be a single object or particle
> - may be a collection of objects or particle
> - may be a region of space
> - may vary with time or shape

No matter what the particular system is given in a problem we first identify the 
**system boundary**: an imaginary surface that divides the universe into a system
and the environment surrounding the system.
