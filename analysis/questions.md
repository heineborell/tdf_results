# Some questions for analysis

As an avid cyclist I try to follow the professional cycling closely from grand tours to one day spring classics. Inherently it has

## Questions about totals

- Average speed each year.
- Total distance, total ascent each year.
- Which cities they have gone? Pinpoint them on map of France. Also from the pros strava uploads we can download and get the route for each year.

## Stage-wise questions

- How many stages has more climbing than average ? Like queen stage each year.
- How does the average speed changes at each stage at each year? This is connected to the recovery metrics of the riders.
- How does the time gaps change in each stage? What does it depend on climbs, flats, wind?
- There is a data section with how each stage ended e.g. sprint, solo or sth else. From this first get the distribution and then try to come up with a model.
- From strava segments data we can filter the downhill or flat segments and try to see if the aerodynamic tech really help on avg speed over the years.

## Pogi specific questions

Pogi obviously don't publish his power data on Strava. However we can still

- The original question was how much Pogi deviates from the standart? at each stage (may be in general time too)
- What about other deviations, like Lance, Indurain, Pantani... or in general the winners. Compare those with Pogi's dominance.
- Pogis performance after doing back to back tours?

## General Strava questions

- How many riders are using strava each year ? This is a two way question they might have strava now but may be they didn't have it at the time soooo might look for the strava uploads but that will take some time.
- From recovery day activities can we get anything related with rest of the tour?
- Who uses what? Garmin, Wahoo or some other device.
- We don't have weather data for older tours but it will be interesting to check the weather effects on speed and power.

## Segment based questions

- How does a rider's power output (watts) vary across different types of stages (mountain, time trial, flat)?

### From Chad gpt

Having access to all Tour de France data and riders' Strava uploads provides a treasure trove of information for analysis. Here are some intriguing statistical questions that could be explored:

### **Performance Analysis**

1. **What factors correlate most strongly with stage wins?**

   - Elevation gain, heart rate zones, cadence, or average speed?

2. **What is the average difference in speed between the peloton and breakaway groups over different stages?**

3. **How does weather (temperature, wind speed, etc.) impact riders' performance metrics like speed and power?**

### **Comparative Analysis**

5. **How do performance metrics differ between GC (General Classification) riders and sprinters?**

6. **What are the differences in recovery metrics (e.g., heart rate variability, rest day activities) between top-performing and average riders?**

7. **Do riders who train more on similar terrain to specific stages perform better on those stages?**

8. **Is there a significant performance difference between riders using different training techniques or equipment?**

### **Physiological Metrics**

9. **What is the relationship between VO2 max estimates and finishing position in the race?**

10. **How does cumulative fatigue over the course of the race affect power output and heart rate zones?**

11. **What is the average calorie expenditure per stage, and how does it relate to rider weight and power output?**

### **Team Dynamics**

12. **What is the contribution of domestiques (support riders) in maintaining team leader positions during critical stages?**

13. **How does team strategy influence breakaway success rates?**

14. **Are certain teams consistently more effective at drafting or pacing during key segments?**

### **Climbing Performance**

15. **How does rider weight-to-power ratio correlate with performance on categorized climbs?**

16. **What is the relationship between pacing strategies on climbs and overall time savings?**

17. **Are lighter riders consistently faster on longer climbs, or does pacing strategy play a bigger role?**

### **Time Trial Analysis**

18. **How do riders optimize their pacing strategies during individual time trials?**

19. **What is the effect of aerodynamic equipment choices on average speed in time trials?**

20. **Is there a significant difference in performance between riders starting early versus late in time trials with varying weather conditions?**

### **Historical and Predictive Analysis**

21. **How has the average speed of the Tour de France changed over decades?**

- Explore factors like technology, training methods, and race strategies.

22. **Can historical Strava data predict future Tour de France stage winners?**

23. **Are riders with higher training variability (e.g., alternating intensities) more likely to improve year over year?**

### **Recovery and Rest**

24. **What rest day activities correlate with better performance in the following stages?**

25. **How do sleep and recovery metrics (if available) impact overall performance?**

### **Social and Behavioral Analysis**

26. **How do ridersâ€™ training behaviors change in the weeks leading up to the Tour?**

27. **Are there patterns in social interaction metrics (e.g., Strava kudos, group rides) that correlate with better performance?**

### **Clustering and Classification**

28. **Can riders be clustered into performance groups based on Strava data (e.g., climbers, sprinters, all-rounders)?**

29. **What are the defining metrics of riders who consistently finish in the top 10?**

30. **Are there identifiable patterns in how stage winners pace themselves compared to other competitors?**

### **General Curiosities**

31. **What is the relationship between rider age and performance metrics across stages?**

32. **Do riders improve their performance metrics over consecutive Tours, or is there a decline due to cumulative wear and tear?**

33. **What is the impact of altitude training on performance in high-altitude stages?**

Each question could lead to fascinating insights when combined with proper visualization and modeling techniques.
