# Introduction


- First of all what are grand tours?
  - There are 3 of them. Tour de France, Giro dItalia and Tour of Spain.
  - They are several stage (usually 21 day) pro-cycling events.
  - Each stage is usually  has different characteristics either alot of climbing involved or flat sprint stages.
  - Riders compete with the help of their teams, in total 180 riders start.
  - Each stage has a winner and in the end the total time of riders are calculated, the rider having the least amount of time wins.

- The final goal should be to predict the total and stage time for each rider which is a ML problem that can be solved using different techniques. Moreover considering the different categories of data one can ask different questions that involve only statistical analysis and visualisations.
